##### Course materials for UCSB CS 292F.300 Spring 2021: Graph Laplacians and Spectral Graph Theory

This repository will be updated throughout the quarter with course materials. You should probably just clone it to your own computer, and do a "git pull" every now and then to keep it up to date. Current contents are:

- [**BookAndNotes**](BookAndNotes/): This directory contains the textbook, which is Dan Spielman's "Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory". It also contains a growing tex/pdf document called "Index of Notation and Definitions", which has lots of goodies in it and will be updated regularly to keep up with lectures.
- **[Data](Data/)**: This directory contains example graphs and some information about them, in several formats.
- [**Julia**](Julia/): This directory contains my custom Julia software for the class. There's not much there; most of our Julia software will be from [Dan Spielman's Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl) package, which you should download and install for yourself.
- [**Matlab**](Matlab/): This directory contains my custom Matlab software for the class, which I may use in demos from time to time. You don't have to run any of this unless you want to.
