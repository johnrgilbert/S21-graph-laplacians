##### Course materials for UCSB CS 292F.300 Spring 2021: Graph Laplacians and Spectral Graph Theory

The main course web site is on [GauchoSpace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/course/view.php?id=112387).

This repository will be updated throughout the quarter with course materials. You should probably just clone it to your own computer, and do a "git pull" every now and then to keep it up to date. Current contents are:

- [**BookAndNotes**](BookAndNotes/): This directory contains the textbook, which is Dan Spielman's "Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory". It also contains a growing tex/pdf document called "Index of Notation and Definitions", which has lots of goodies in it and will be updated regularly to keep up with lectures.
- [**LectureMaterials**](LectureMaterials/): This directory contains the materials I use or generate in each lecture, including ipad/whiteboard images, Matlab transcripts and figures, and any slides. It doesn't include the recorded Zoom videos, which are too big for this site; to find those, go to GauchoSpace.
- [**Homework**](Homework/): This directory contains all the homework assignments, including LaTeX source, and any auxiliary files needed for assignments.
- [**Projects**](Projects/): This directory's README.md has the policy and schedule for the final projects, and some suggested topics. It will eventually also contain all the project proposals and final project reports.
- [**Data**](Data/): This directory contains example graphs and some information about them, in several formats.
- [**Julia**](Julia/): This directory contains my custom Julia software for the class. There's not much there; most of our Julia software will be from [Dan Spielman's Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl) package, which you should download and install for yourself.
- [**Matlab**](Matlab/): This directory contains my custom Matlab software for the class, which I may use in demos from time to time. You don't have to run any of this unless you want to.
